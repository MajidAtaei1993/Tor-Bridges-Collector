# Tor Bridges Collector & Archive

This repository automatically collects, validates, and archives Tor bridges. A GitHub Action runs hourly to fetch new bridges from the official Tor Project and appends unique entries to the lists.

**Note:** This is an accumulative archive. New bridges are added to the files without deleting the old ones, creating a comprehensive list of potential connection points.

## 📂 Bridge Lists (Raw Links)

Use these direct links to import bridges into Tor Browser, Orbot, or other clients:
